# 2FA Code Autofill

A Chrome extension that automatically detects two-factor authentication (2FA) input fields and suggests verification codes from your Gmail.

## Features

-   Automatically detects 2FA code input fields on websites
-   Searches your Gmail for recent verification codes
-   Offers to autofill detected codes with a single click
-   Works with most common 2FA implementations

## How It Works

1. When you visit a website with a 2FA input field, the extension detects it
2. The extension searches your recent Gmail messages for verification codes
3. If a code is found, a small popup appears offering to autofill it
4. Click "Autofill" to automatically enter the code

## Privacy & Security

-   The extension only accesses Gmail when a 2FA field is detected
-   All data processing happens locally in your browser
-   The extension requires minimal permissions
-   No analytics or tracking code is included
